OstrichLand USA	['animals']	516	688	Ostrichland is a “zoo” just off the highway where you can see ostriches and emus. You can also feed them and visit the gift shop of ostrich-related items, including eggs. Ostrich meat is also sold in the gift shop but the farm’s ostriches and emus are not raised for meat–only for enjoyment.	Get up close to emus and ostriches, or buy their tasty meat.

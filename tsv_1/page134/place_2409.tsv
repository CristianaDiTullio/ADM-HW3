Randy's Donuts	['Unique Restaurants & Bars', 'shops', 'monuments']	1030	883	Constructed in 1953, Randy’s Donuts, a 24-hour donut shop in Inglewood, California boasts one of the most iconic and certainly one of the most playful facades in Los Angeles.
Just beyond an off-ramp of the I-405, a giant donut (32.5’ in diameter) stands proudly atop the roof of the otherwise modest building, serving as a beacon for donut lovers everywhere. Randy’s has made cameos in dozens of films, including Iron Man 2, and, indeed, its fame has certainly spread. The combination of Randy’s Donuts’ simple drive-through layout and mouthwatering treats has cars lining up down the block at all hours.	A giant donut stands as a popular symbol of Los Angeles iconography.

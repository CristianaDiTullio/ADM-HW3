Spectacle Theater	['film']	128	706	Housed in a former bodega, Spectacle is a collectively run movie theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, established and staffed entirely by volunteers. It’s known for showing offbeat, underseen gems and hosting events including live scores featuring local groups, mass hypnosis, interactive theater, and slideshows with tiki accompaniments. The polar opposite of a chain theater, this no-frills cinephile haven is BYO-snacks and beverages. Midnights are a specialty, though they’re open seven days a week year-round.	A no-frills cinephile haven known for showing offbeat, underseen films.

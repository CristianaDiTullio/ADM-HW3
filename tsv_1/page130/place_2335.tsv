Curia Arcanum 	['oddities', 'shops', 'collections']	158	897	Austin’s semi-official tag line is “Keep Austin Weird” and there are few places that exemplify this spirit more than this Victorian-style oddity shop.
Inside, curious wanderers can find everything from unique artwork to a taxidermied specimen of the mythical wolpertinger. The shop also plays host to a small library of mystical books and other oddities spanning the world obscura. Curia Arcanum shares the property with another curiosity shop, The Glass Coffin: Vampire Parlour, making this location a two-for-one tribute to the weirder side of Austin.	This eclectic Austin curiosity shop is home to all things strange and unusual.

Victim of the Beast Gravestone	['memento mori', 'catacombs and crypts', 'monuments']	370	899	The strange inscription on this tombstone reads “Lilly E. Gray, Victim of the Beast 666.” 
But it’s unclear which is stranger–the inscription or the fact that no one seems to know what it means or why it was placed here.
It seems inherently mean-spririted, yet everything else about the grave marker seems lovingly planned and cared for. It has been more than half a century since Lilly died, if that is indeed her name, and the mystery of the meaning behind the inscription endures.	Here lies Lilly E. Gray, an alleged "Victim of the Beast," but no one knows why.

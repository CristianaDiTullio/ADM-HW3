Crescent City Cat Club	['rescues', 'cats', 'places to stay', 'animals']	125	554	In a beautiful old house in the Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans, you’ll find a cat lover’s paradise. The Crescent City Cat Club is a nonprofit that works with a local rescue to provide an environment for shelter cats and kittens to help them socialize and ultimately get adopted. There are lots of comfortable places to sit, including a small patio where you and the kitties are free to hang out. There is even a cottage attached to the cat club that you can rent out for the night. If you love cats, it’s a must-visit in the Crescent City.	A calm and comfortable place to hang out with cats and kittens up for adoption.

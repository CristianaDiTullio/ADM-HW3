Roseanne's House	['film locations', 'places to stay']	173	556	The exterior of this private home was used as the establishing shot in the opening sequence for the popular sitcom, Roseanne.  
While the interior of the home was a Hollywood set, the few seconds that featured this home’s porch during the opening credits still bring the show to mind.
Roseanne’s hangout, the Lobo Lounge, is also in Evansville as are the Third & Delaware street sign and church used in the transition photos in the show.	The home used in just a few seconds of film that came to define the setting of a hit sitcom.

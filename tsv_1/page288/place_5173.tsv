Gates of Hell Hacienda Heights	['gates to hell', 'gate', 'abandoned']	113	541	Rumored to have once been the location of a sanatorium back in the 1940s, the hospital was reportedly shut down due to multiple cases of malpractice.
The property has since been fenced off for about a decade, with rolls of barbed wire suspiciously inside the fence, as if to keep something or someone in. The Gates themselves instill a feeling of dread and no one seems to know why the property is fenced up and under close supervision. Itâ€™s not uncommon to hear voices or subtle footsteps crunching through the brush near the property.	This mysterious and creepy location instills a strong sense of foreboding in all visitors.

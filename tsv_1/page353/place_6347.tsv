Geological Museum	['science museums', 'wonder cabinets', 'wunderkammers', 'geological oddities', 'geology', 'museums and collections', 'museums']	172	457	Part of the Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen, the Geological Museum has specimens sourced from collections started in the 1700s, as well as a recreation of Denmark’s most famous curiosity cabinet.
The collections include segments of the Cape York meteorites discovered in Greenland, along with around a million invertebrate specimens, fossilized plant material in a paleobotanical collection, and other minerals and paleontology materials. 
Permanently installed since 2011 is an installation by artist Rosamond Purcell that recreates the Danish physician Ole Worm’s iconic 17th century curiosity cabinet. Each stuffed bird, taxidermied fish, mounted antler, and natural or manmade oddity has been reproduced in a small room that duplicates that which was seen in the 1655 engraving of Ole Worm’s cabinet.

A'DAM Lookout and Over The Edge Swing	['panoramas', 'bars']	454	1453	The A’DAM tower tower may look brand new, but this landmark tower was actually opened in 1971, when it was home to oil company Royal Dutch Shell. Following a multi-million euro refit, the A’DAM Tower was born in early 2016 as one of Amsterdam’s most exciting nightlife and creative hubs, and its first public observation deck.
Looming tall over the Amsterdam North skyline, the Skydeck at the top of the 22-floor tower offers a magnificent 360-degree view of Amsterdam’s city center. At the Skydeck you can find the highest swing in Europe. With a safety harness you swing back and forth at a dizzying height of nearly 100 meters above Amsterdam.	This 22-floor tower's Skydeck offers panoramic views of Amsterdam.

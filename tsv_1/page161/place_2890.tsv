Kissing Rock	['geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'geology', 'nature']	306	794	While there are plenty of rocks where teenagers go to kiss, this “kissing rock” is particular in that it is not just teenagers kissing, it is the rocks themselves.
Found along the coastline in Pacific Grove California, it is a dramatic granite arch where two rocks meet and look like a a couple kissing, as waves crash underneath and behind them.
Called the “Kissing Rock” since Victorian times, it was a popular destination for petticoated ladies and mustachioed gentleman to come and take sepia-toned photos.
The site was officially designated the “Kissing Rocks” on April 1, 1970 and Life Magazine later called Pacific Grove the most romantic spot in America!	Two rocks in a perpetual kiss and one of "the most romantic spot in America."

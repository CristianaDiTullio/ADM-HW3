The Tomb of Nefertari	['tomb', 'burial places', 'ancient']	238	442	The vast array of paintings inside the tomb of Nefertari, the first of the Great Royal Wives of Ramesses the Great, look as if they were painted just days ago. The vivid colors give visitors a clear idea of what some of the tombs and temples in the area looked like during antiquity. The tomb shows off a different level of detail compared to the other tombs found in Valley of the Kings or even the rest of the Valley of the Queens.	Known as the Sistine Chapel of Egypt, this tomb houses some of the most well-preserved paintings in Egypt.

Lockspot Cafe	['Unique Restaurants & Bars']	397	472	Visitors to Seattle’s Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, hungry after viewing fish swimming up the locks’ fish ladder, can get their fill of seafood at the nearby Lockspot Cafe.
Located across the street from the entrance to Ballard’s famous water lock complex, the rustic cafe features a wood-paneled interior and seaside motif that is as welcoming to salty fishermen as it is to adventurous tourists. However, if visitors would like to enjoy more of the outdoors, or even bring some food for a picnic at the locks, the Lockspot offers a walk-up takeaway window and tables out front beneath its folk art mermaid mural.
The eatery offers a wide variety of classic American fare, but as the sign on its facade states, the Lockspot Cafe is famous for its fish and chips, which is befitting a location so inextricably tied to the water.	An eclectic restaurant serving from and to the nearby Chittenden Locks.	['Carl S. English Jr. Botanical Gardens', 'Hiram M.

Forty Acre Rock Heritage Preserve	['geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'plants', 'geology', 'nature', 'animals']	132	529	Named for a massive granite standing rock that is actually closer to fourteen acres in size, the Forty Acre Rock Heritage Preserve is set in a 2,267-acre park in South Carolina that is open for hiking. The rock, a celebrated example of a granite outcropping in the Piedmont, is one of several exposures throughout the region. Many of the others, though, are mined for their valuable high-quality granite, the state’s official rock.
Forty Acre Rock’s granite, as part of the Flat Creek Preserve, is home to several species of rare plants, including Puck’s orpine, diminutive amphianthus, and open ground Whitlow grass. The state does not advertise the area as a tourist attraction because of the fragile ecosystem it supports.
There are no places to camp - legally, anyway - and no restrooms, showers, phones or other modern amenities, but the area can be explored during the daytime. If you plan on visiting, pack your own water, food, and supplies as there are no local stores in the area.
Update January 2019: There’s a store just up the road no more than three miles. This store also has bathrooms, a grill (hamburgers/hotdogs/sandwiches) hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.	Granite outcropping that the state's tourism bureau doesn't promote because of its delicate ecosystem.

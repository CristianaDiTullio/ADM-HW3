The Bunker Hill Covered Bridge	['inventions', 'monuments']	310	1285	The appeal of covered bridges is undeniable. Their rich history and their tendency to be found in random, out-of-the-way places offer a bemusing combination to country wanderers.
The Bunker Hill Covered Bridge is a National Civil Engineering Landmark, and is one of the 221 known remaining lattice truss bridges in the country. Engineering historians can find plenty to be fascinated by with this bridge, but casual onlookers are also attracted to its whimsical appearance. Built to cross Lyle Creek in 1894, the bridge didn’t receive its status as “covered” until 1900. Family-owned until 1985, it is now in the capable hands of the Catawba County Historical Association, who restored it in 1994 and continue to maintain it as a National Civil Engineering Landmark.	A historic covered bridge, only one of two remaining in North Carolina.

The museum features old tools and implements for turning hemp into rope, paper, and clothing, as well as a variety of ancient and not so ancient smoking devices. Visitors can also get a better understanding of the cannabis plant by checking out the indoor cannabis garden located inside the museum.
The museum examines hashish, marijuana, and hemp using a variety of media from photography and film to books and paintings, both ancient and modern and the history, and the current use of the cannabis plant is covered in depth. Though the plant is still controversial in many regions of the world, the museum aims to teach visitors about how useful hemp, marijuana, and hash was in past civilizations and how we might use the plant to better our industries and environment of today.

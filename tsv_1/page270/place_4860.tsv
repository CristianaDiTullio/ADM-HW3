Salt Lake City Public Library	['repositories of knowledge', 'libraries']	991	565	Thoughts of a public library inevitably turn to rows of bookcases, shushing librarians, and little plastic chairs for quiet contemplation.
But the Salt Lake City Public Library is something else altogether. A truly modern work of architectural art, itâ€™s just about the last thing one would think of when invited to visit a library. Closer to the look of a museum of art, the breathtakingly vast glass atrium allows natural light to stream in and breathe life into a space traditionally known for subtle, ambient light. The results are nothing short of inspirational.
Exploring the library is encouraged. In addition to having over 500,000 books, there is also a rooftop garden, as well as an apiary tucked away on the 5th floor.	Visitors to this library are in for a real-world education in modernist architecture.

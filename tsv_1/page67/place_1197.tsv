Ladder Creek Falls and Gardens	['national parks']	117	1268	Ladder Creek Falls and Gardens in North Cascades National Park is lovely to visit anytime, but the real draw is the light show that runs from dusk to midnight daily.  
The luminescent show was started in the 1920s by Seattle City Light Superintendent of Lighting J.D. Ross. The falls were illuminated with all the colors of the rainbow, coupled with music which drifted through the gardens.  In 2008 City Light began installing a new lighting system using LED bulbs, and the revived light show debuted in 2011. Visitors can stroll through the gardens and enjoy the falls in various shades and combinations of blue, red, green and white.
Update October 2018: The location has not been maintained for years.  Some of the lights work still and some of the trail is impassable at times.	The illuminated falls are a gem in North Cascades National Park.

Sea of Stars	['reefs', 'glowing', 'bioluminescence', 'oceans', 'natural wonders', 'water', 'nature']	22	464	The “Sea of Stars” is a beautiful phenomenon that occurs during late summer in the reefs of the Maldives, caused by bioluminescent phytoplankton called Lingulodinium polyedrum. The water here is filled with this plankton, and the movement of the waves causes it to glow, creating an incredible shimmering effect that looks like the sea is full of stars.	Bioluminescence in the reefs of the Maldives causes the sea to glow like a starry night sky.

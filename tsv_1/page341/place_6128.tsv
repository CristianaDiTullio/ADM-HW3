Musée de la Contrefaçon	['hoaxes', 'collections', 'museums']	85	470	Established by the Union of Manufacturers, the Musée de la Contrefaçon (Museum of the Counterfeit) in Paris, France is devoted to the sometimes astoundingly good knock-offs that permeate our culture.
In the museum, which was intended to be a weapon in the battle against counterfeiting, real items are placed side by side with their bootleg counterparts, presumably to demonstrate the superiority of the real thing. Compare and contrast real and fake Swiss Army Knives, Veuve Cliquot bottles and Rodin bronzes, among other products.	An odd museum dedicated to French fakes.

Arabia Mountain	['martian landscapes', 'landscapes', 'mountains', 'ecosystems']	323	626	If you’re looking for a distinctly local experience in Atlanta, you’ll visit Arabia Mountain, located in the town of Lithonia outside the city. Arabia Mountain is Stone Mountain’s cooler, less crowded, and less controversial sibling (no massive confederate memorial etched into the side). There’s a lot of history behind this rock and its alien landscape, but just know that it’s well worth the drive—roughly 30 minutes from downtown Atlanta.	Like Mars, but much closer.

Kenka	['Unique Restaurants & Bars']	276	866	Throughout its history, St. Marks Place has played host to mafia-hits, artist quarters and the country’s first cooking school. In many ways, its one of the only streets where you can really find anything.
Of course this also applies to dining, and Kenka fits the bill in a distinctly St. Marks fashion. Many of the dishes at Kenka don’t seem like traditional Japanese fare, and are a far cry from tempura and sushi. However, the exotic plates here are a perfect foreign meal for adventure-seeking appetites.	Make a tough dinner decision: Octopus wasabi roulette or bull penis?

Balestrino Ghost Village	['ruins']	46	852	Little is known about the details of the building or the abandoning of this picturesque Italian hill town, but today is stands empty and slowly decaying. Unfortunately, you canâ€™t get in anymore. It has been completely fenced off. Which just makes it more intrigueing.	Abandoned medieval hill town.

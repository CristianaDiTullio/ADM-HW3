Lobster Mickey	['statues']	278	672	For Mickey Mouse’s 75th birthday, Disney commissioned artists across the country to decorate 700 pound mickey statues for their local region.
The Boston area really took that “local” part seriously. 
Artist Breanna Rowlette created “Lobsta’ Mickey,” a tribute to Boston’s close ties to seafood and linquistic accent. The six foot tall mouse is charming and strange at the same time… there’s something about a rodent with giant claws that can’t help but be a tad unsettling. He can be found at Faneuil Hall marketplace. 
Update 2015: Sadly Lobster Mickey is no longer present. He got auctioned off in 2005 for 9000$ to an unknown bidder.	This "life-size" depiction of Mickey Mouse as a half-lobster is both whimsical and a bit creepy, standing guard over the Boston waterfront.

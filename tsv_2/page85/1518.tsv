South Mountain Fairy Trail	['imaginary world', 'fairies', 'magic', 'miniatures', 'trails', 'forests', 'houses', 'homes', 'ecosystems', 'nature']	259	1140	"Intricate little fairy houses, made mostly of natural materials, line a stretch of trail in the South Mountain Reservation park near Millburn, New Jersey.
These minute birdhouse-like creations feature teeny chairs made of acorns, ladders made of twigs, beds made of moss, and roofs made of tree bark. Walkers can expect to find them tucked within the tangle of trees along the trail’s edge.
Therese Ojibway, a special education teacher, started building and placing the fairy houses along the trail in 2011 to offer unexpected surprises for outdoor explorers. She originally added her miniature touches of magic anonymously, but revealed herself after ill-received imitation structures began popping in the area."	These mystical miniature houses bring a touch of magic to the New Jersey woods.

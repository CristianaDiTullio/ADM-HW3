SPARK Museum of Electrical Invention	['radio', 'electricity', 'television', 'technology', 'museums and collections', 'museums']	122	435	"This museum is packed with gadgets from the early days of scientific electrical experiments. The various pieces of historic equipment date from the 16th through 20th centuries, providing a timeline of the electrical innovations that shaped human history.
What began as one man’s personal collection of old radio paraphernalia grew into what’s now the SPARK Museum of Electrical Invention. Now the museum contains far more than hundreds of antique radios, boasting treasures like rare books and papers by the likes of Benjamin Franklin, Galileo, and William Gilbert.
The space is well set up for older children and adults, and there are plenty of neat things to see. The museum houses one of the United States’ largest collections of 19th-century electromagnetic apparatus, as well as multiple lamps from Thomas Edison’s laboratory.
But, these aren’t the only highlights: the museum’s MegaZapper, a Tesla coil, also puts on an electrifying show. For those looking to get a bit more hands-on, there’s even a Theremin visitors can play."	An electrifying collection of gadgets and literature from the 16th through 20th centuries.

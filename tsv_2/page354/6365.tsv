Old Cahawba Archeological Park	['ghost towns', 'parks', 'archaeology', 'abandoned', 'ruins']	116	455	"Cahawba (also known as Cahaba) was the state capital of Alabama from 1819 to 1826. It was also the county seat of Dallas County, Alabama, until 1866, at which point its population was a little under 2,000. But by 1900, most of Cahawba’s inhabitants had left. Its buildings were dismantled, their materials used elsewhere.
Cahawba is no longer inhabited, but the ruins of the former town and a couple of remaining buildings can be viewed as part of today’s archeological park. It’s incredible to make out the foundations of what had been a major town, complete with a church, prison, two cemeteries, river access, and many houses. The streets are accessible as they were laid out at that time (on foot and by car)."	This ghost town houses the remains of Alabama's old state capital.

H.P. Lovecraft’s Grave	['h. p. lovecraft', 'memento mori', 'catacombs and crypts', 'graves']	463	792	"Howard Phillips Lovecraft was a horror fiction writer whose work went unrecognized during his short, impoverished life (1890-1937). Since his death, however, he’s grown in literary stature to become, for many, second only to Edgar Allan Poe in that arena.
He lived almost his entire life in Providence, RI, and died there as well. His grave can be found in Swan Point Cemetery, a large, well kept, park-like cemetery on the outskirts of the city along the banks of the Seekonk River. His grave is located at the intersection of Pond Avenue and Avenue B (which turns into Hemlock Avenue at some point) in the cemetery.
His marker is small, and hidden by the tall obelisk that denotes the Philips plot. The inscription reads, “I Am Providence.”

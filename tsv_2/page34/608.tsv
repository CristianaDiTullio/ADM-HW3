The Mar Vista Time Travel Mart	['education']	317	1735	"The Mar Vista Time Travel Mart is the sister store to the Echo Park Time Travel Mart, and the second iteration in the chain. 
Both storefronts house 826LA, the non-profit tutoring and writing center. The Mar Vista Time Travel Mart sells time travel products just like the Echo Park location, but in a general store, mercantile atmosphere. It’s got a vastly different set of patrons due to its location in West Los Angeles.  There are less pieces of literature from the non-profit for sale at this location as opposed to the original location. This location also does not have the “grit” that it’s parent store has, which is a noticeable difference."	Sister store to the Echo Park Time Travel Store.

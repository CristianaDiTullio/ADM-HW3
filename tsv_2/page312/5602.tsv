Abandoned Summit Greenhouse	['greenhouses', 'mystery', 'abandoned', 'plants']	75	513	"Not much is known about this abandoned greenhouse that spans almost half a football field, hidden by the overgrowth in Summit, New Jersey. 
The shattered remains of the giant structure can be found across a tiny brook by a local park. Shards of glass litter the ground. The greenhouse is embellished with incredible amounts of graffiti, abandoned furniture, irrigation systems, terracotta planters, and a mystical charm that denotes a sense of otherworldliness. 
Old boards have been found inside with the name “Carl’s Greenhouse” written on them, but the history of the place remains a mystery. Some believe the structure dates back to the 1920s, based on the date found on a brick from the area. Judging from the artifacts and machinery inside the greenhouse, it appears to have been abandoned in the 1970s. It has been slowly being taken over by nature ever since. 
Update September 2018: this Greenhouse was torn down due to disrepair."	An enormous overgrown greenhouse teeming with graffiti and wildlife.

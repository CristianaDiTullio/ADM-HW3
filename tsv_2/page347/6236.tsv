Mên-an-Tol (Circle Stone)	['rock formations']	146	464	"The circle stone within a stone circle, dating from the Neolithic or Bronze age, is said to be a gateway to health or fertility and guarded by a fairy or “piskie.” Legend has it humans who pass through the stone will be cured of ailments or a woman will be blessed with fertility if she passes through on a full moon. 
The circle is hidden in farmland surrounded by tall grass and beautiful cattle and is found near other ancient sites."	A circle stone within a stone circle.

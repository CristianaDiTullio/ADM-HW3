Miamisburg Mound	['catacombs and crypts']	426	727	"The Miamisburg Mound is a large Native American conical burial mound constructed by the culture that archaeologists refer to as Adena.  The mound is almost 70 feet tall and is virtually intact. Visitors can climb to the top of the mound via a concrete staircase.
The mound tomb was constructed approximately 2500 years ago as one of many similar mound earthworks. Excavations in 1869 revealed a bark-covered skeleton and a chamber located 28 feet deep into the mound, but the chamber was found to be empty.
The Adena people flourished between 1000-200 BC and established their homes across what is now Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and New York. There are several burial mounds and an estimated 200 other Adena-related sites scattered throughout their territory.
The Miamisburg Mound is in a local park and is a designated Ohio Historical Site."	The largest ancient burial mound in Ohio.

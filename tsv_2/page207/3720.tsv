The Anatomy of Death Museum	['anatomy museums']	100	683	"Take a step through the body bag curtains and into this museum full of macabre artifacts, many dating back to the early 19th-century. Inside this museum dedicated to death are ceremonial masks, embalming tools, disfigured bones, Civil War amputation kits, and many more medical and funeral oddities. 
As creepy music plays, you are given a semi-guided tour through dozens of historical objects. After checking out the exhibits, get your photo taken on a used embalming table. If the owner is around, you might even get the chance to hold a real human skull."	A museum dedicated to the dead and the tools used to usher them into the afterlife.

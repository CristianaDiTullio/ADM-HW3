Guyot Glacier Ice Caves	['ice caves', 'caves', 'natural wonders', 'ecosystems', 'nature']	40	705	"This ice cave, in Alaska’s Guyot Glacier, was carved or melted out by the stream that is running along the cave floor. It’s about 8 meters high.
Larger ice caves like this may be filled with stream sediment, and if the glacier melts without erasing it, the result is a long winding ridge of sand called an esker."	Gorgeous cave resemble a winter wonderland.	['Kennicott Ghost Town', 'Kuskulana River Bridge', 'Valdez Museum & Historical Archive']	"Yakutat, Alaska United States

The Rapid City Presidents	['sculpture gardens', 'presidents', 'sculptures', 'statues']	721	410	"It usually takes a special occasion to stand in the company of a President of the United States, let alone several. Rapid City makes it a bit easier.
Over the course of several blocks in downtown Rapid City, visitors will find a life-sized bronze statue of every President in the history of the United States. A bit eccentric in number, there is no denying the respect and care with which the city has erected these statues."	Every president in history is immortalized in bronze in downtown Rapid City.

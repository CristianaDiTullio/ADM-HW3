Budapest Chairlift	['forests', 'ecosystems']	173	520	"A fun and unique way to travel between Zugliget and the lookout tower on János Hill, the highest peak in the city. The chairlift was built in 1970. Along the way, you can take in a beautiful panorama from your chairlift until you arrive at the peak, 528 meters (1732 ft) above sea-level. The hill is crowned by the Elizabeth Lookout Tower. The journey is about 15 minutes in both directions.
It’s an ideal way to see part of Budapest without navigating the hustle and bustle of the city."	A two-way chairlift system between Zugliget and the highest point in the city.

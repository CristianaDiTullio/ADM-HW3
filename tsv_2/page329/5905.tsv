The Yorkville Rock	['public', 'parks', 'natural wonders', 'geology', 'nature']	664	484	"Unsatisfied with the local stones, Toronto city planners had the Yorkville Rock broken apart so that it could be relocated to the middle of an urban park.
Approximately one billion years old, “The Rock” weighs 650 tons and represents the roots of an ancient mountain range that has long since eroded. The rock was removed in pieces from the Canadian glacial shield and transported in huge fragments on 20 flatbed trailers to Toronto’s Yorkville Park. As each rock section arrived, it was reassembled to minimize visible joints, although gaps remain which give the stone the look of a tectonic puzzle."	This massive, ancient stone was disassembled and then put back together again.

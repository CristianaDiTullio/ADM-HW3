Webster Place 	['architectural oddities', 'architecture']	156	484	"Brooklyn has an abundance of spectacular architecture—from the original Federal homes of Brooklyn Heights, to the world famous brownstones of Prospect Park to the Victorian mansions of Ditmas Park. But perhaps its most beautiful row of homes lie on a secluded street hidden away in southern Park Slope.
Like much of Manhattan, Park Slope runs on a strict grid system. But in the middle of Prospect Avenue and 16 Street, between 6th and 7th Avenues, runs a tiny forgotten street which cuts through the block; Webster Place. 
And this solitary street is home to the most elegantly preserved Queen Anne style homes in the city. Beautifully painted and maintained, these columned porches and wood-framed houses make you think you are walking in San Francisco.
Dating back to the late 1860s, there are no records as to who built these remarkable homes, but they remain one of the cities most beautiful and hidden collection of houses."	A hidden architectural treasure in New York's Brooklyn.

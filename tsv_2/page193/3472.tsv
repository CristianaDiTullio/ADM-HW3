Museo Storico Nazionale Dell' Arte Sanitaria	['anatomical venuses', 'anatomical theaters', 'wax anatomy', 'anatomy museums', 'medical museums', 'museums and collections', 'history']	93	722	"Located just east of Rome’s Vatican City, this medical history museum is housed in a former anatomical theater where students dissected corpses to better understand human anatomy. The anatomical theater was part of the complex of Santo Spirito in Sassia, a learning hospital established in the 12th century.
Today, the museum includes a reconstruction of a 17th-century pharmacy and alchemical laboratory (where you can see a reproduction of Rome’s famous alchemical door), a large library of old books, and an impressive display of anatomical models. The wax models include the alleged skull of Pliny the Elder, and a rare ivory anatomical Venus from the 17th century."	One of the most important yet well-hidden museums dedicated to the history of medicine.

Jasmine Hill Gardens & Outdoor Museum	['statues', 'museums']	78	418	"Just off the beaten path down a rural road, you wouldn’t expect to come across ancient Greek style statues in Wetumpka, Alabama.
Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, Benjamin and Mary Fitzpatrick purchased the land during the 1930s. They frequently traveled to Greece and often returned with original and replica statues. They decided to use them to create a unique outdoor museum. If you arrive at the gardens as the sun is setting on a late fall day, you might be greeted by the familiar sounds of squirrels rustling through leaves of Camellias. 
Update: As of 2020, this place is permanently closed."	"This botanical garden has been nicknamed ""Alabama's Little Corner of Greece."""

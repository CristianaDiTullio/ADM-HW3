Whiteford Lighthouse	['lighthouses', 'water', 'architecture']	65	489	"This dominating cast-iron lighthouse was  built in 1865 at Whiteford Point.
It rises 44 feet above the water and is only accessible at low tide, and even then there’s a risk of wet feet. Whiteford Lighthouse is unique in its survival as the only wave-swept cast-iron lighthouse in British coastal waters, and deeply significant to the history of cast-iron architecture. 
It holds the status of a Scheduled Ancient Monument."	This lonely cast-iron structure is the only wave-washed lighthouse of its kind left in all of Britain.	"['Former RAF Pembrey Airfield', ""Maen Ceti (Arthur's Stone)"", 'The Great Welsh Amelia Earhart Controversy']"	"Wales United Kingdom

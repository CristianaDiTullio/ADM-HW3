Pancake Rocks	['geological oddities', 'natural wonders', 'geology', 'nature']	656	489	"The Pancake Rocks are a heavily eroded limestone area where the sea bursts through a number of vertical blowholes during high tides, creating a kind of geyser effect.
Together with the “pancake” layering of the limestone — created by immense pressure on alternating hard and soft layers of marine creatures and plant sediments — it makes for a very strange and beautiful environment.
The coastal promontory of the Pancake Rocks is looped by an easy walking track — 15 minutes, or as long as you want to take to stare into the fascinating surge pool at the point (known as the Devil’s Cauldron), catch the blowholes in action, or enjoy the sweeping views down the Paparoa National Park coastline."	This strange geological landscape erupts with sudden bursts of water.

The Walt Disney Family Museum	['disney', 'museums']	395	433	"The Walt Disney Family Museum offers a historical tour through the life of Walt Disney and his close relatives. It also journeys through the early years of the company he created.
The exhibits feature many family artifacts, awards, and photos, as well as videos of his early animation work. The museum also doesn’t shy away from showing the less favorable side of the studio’s history.
The Walt Disney Family Museum is located on the grounds of the Presidio, a former military installation located between San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge."	Inside this museum, the history of the Walt Disney Family empire is on full display.

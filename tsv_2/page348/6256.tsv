Rhinestone Cowboy House at the JMK Arts Center	['outsider architecture']	144	464	"Loy Allen Bowlin was known for his shuffle-step dancing, jokes and off-key singing.
He was, of course, most well known as the “Rhinestone Cowboy” for his artistic rhinestone creations, including his rhinestone polyester leisure suits, rhinestone cowboy boots and rhinestone hats. Bowlin even had rhinestones embedded in his dentures. He didn’t stop there, covering every inch of his house in his sparkling rhinestone art. His house, which was in Mississippi, has been moved in an effort to preserve it and now is on display at the Kohler Arts Center in Wisconsin.
The John Michael Kohler Arts Center specializes in outsider artists, or environmental builders; while there be sure to check out the work of Nek Chand, Tom Every, and Sam Rodia, all wonderful outsider artists in their own right."	"A bedazzled house and crown ""jewel"" of outsider artist Loy Allen Bowlin."

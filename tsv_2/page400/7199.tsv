Cook & Book	['bookstores']	126	410	"Cook & Book in Brussels is far more than just a bookstore. It’s the size of a supermarket and divided into eight different sections, heavily decorated with kitsch and glamour.
A full Airstream caravan sits inside the travel section, while myriads of superhero toys adorn the walls of the comic book entryway. Marklin’s largest model railway track winds through the children’s section. Ornate furniture and vinyl records decorate the inside of the Rock n’ Roll room. A few more steps further, and you’ll find the greenhouse for the store’s nature collection, and then you’ll see a small, refurbished Fiat inside the cooking section, La Cucina. Lastly, a British section ends the shop, and spills out to the outdoor dining area where you can grab a drink and a snack."	A wonderfully kitsch bookstore the size of a supermarket.
